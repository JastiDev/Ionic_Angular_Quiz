<h3 style="color:blue;">A First Look at the World Economy</h3>
<p>
  Let's imagine for a minute that you are the owner of a large company that creates computer hardware. Each day you see
  that your machines are working efficiently and that your employees are satisfactorily doing their job. You also look at
  your sales numbers to see that you are meeting the demand of your domestic consumers. However, one morning while reading
  an article online, you realize that German manufacturers are not meeting demands in your line of work. A major computer
  hardware production company has failed there, and, as a result, German companies are scrambling to avoid having a
  shortage of computers and computer parts for sale. You read that Germany has begun to import products from other
  countries in order to meet this demand. After researching how much of your product might be in demand as well as how
  much exporting your product might cost, you decide to ramp up supply and create a partnership with relevant German
  clients. Congratulations, you have just become an active part of the world economy.

<h3 style="color:blue;">Economy Defined</h3>
<p>
In order to understand what the world economy is, you must first understand what an economy is. An economy is all the
activity that is related to producing and consuming goods and services in a specific area. For example, the city of
Chicago has a unique economy. This economy takes into account all of the goods created in the city. These goods are
tangible items such as computer screens that are created in a factory, and they are intangible products such as new
software and new websites that are created by individuals and companies in Chicago. The Chicago economy also takes into
account companies that provide services in Chicago, such as restaurants and city tours. All of the business conducted in
the city adds up, and citizens of Chicago find they are either in a good economy or a bad economy. A good economy means
that, as a whole, the businesses in Chicago are making a profit--they are growing and making money. A bad economy means
that, generally speaking, companies in Chicago are not doing well--they are struggling to find customers and perhaps
laying people off or cutting wages in response.

The same principle applies to a country. The United States' economy is good or bad based on the performance of
businesses throughout the country. Each country on earth has an economy and, as you might predict, those businesses and
economies interact. The result of that interaction is called the world economy.
