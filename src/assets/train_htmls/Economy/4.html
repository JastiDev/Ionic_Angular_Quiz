  Robert Toru Kiyosaki (born April 8, 1947) is an American businessman and author.[1] Kiyosaki is the founder of Rich
  Global LLC and the Rich Dad Company, a private financial education company that provides personal finance and business
  education to people through books and videos.[2] The company's main revenues come from franchisees of the Rich Dad
  seminars that are conducted by independent individuals using Kiyosaki's brand name for a fee.[citation needed] He is
  also the creator of the Cashflow board and software games to educate adults and children about business and financial
  concepts.[3]

  Kiyosaki's seminars in the United States and Canada are conducted in collaboration with a company called Whitney
  Information Network and are contracted out to local companies as franchisees in other countries.[4] However, some
  attendees have sued Kiyosaki on claims that his high-priced seminars did not deliver anything special.[5]

  Kiyosaki is the author of more than 26 books, including the international self-published personal finance Rich Dad Poor
  Dad series of books which has been translated into 51 languages and sold over 41 million copies worldwide.[6][7] He has
  been criticized for advocating practices of debatable legality perceived as "get rich quick" philosophy.[8] Kiyosaki is
  the subject of a class action suit filed by people who attended his seminars and has been the subject of two
  investigative documentaries by CBC Canada and WTAE USA.[9][10] Kiyosaki's company filed for bankruptcy in 2012.[11]
