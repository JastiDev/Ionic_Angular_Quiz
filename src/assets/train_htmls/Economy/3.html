  <h1>Warren Buffett</h1>
  <p>
    Warren Edward Buffett (/ˈbʌfɪt/; born August 30, 1930)[2] is an American investor, business tycoon, and philanthropist,
    who is the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. He is considered one of the most successful investors in the
    world[3][4] and has a net worth of US$88.9 billion as of December 2019, making him the fourth-wealthiest person in the
    world.[5]

    Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska. He developed an interest in business and investing in his youth, eventually
    entering the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1947 before transferring and graduating from the
    University of Nebraska at the age of 19. He went on to graduate from Columbia Business School, where he molded his
    investment philosophy around the concept of value investing that was pioneered by Benjamin Graham. He attended New York
    Institute of Finance to focus his economics background and soon after began various business partnerships, including one
    with Graham. He created Buffett Partnership, Ltd in 1956 and his firm eventually acquired a textile manufacturing firm
    called Berkshire Hathaway, assuming its name to create a diversified holding company. In 1978, Charlie Munger joined
    Buffett and became vice-chairman of the company.[6][7]

    Buffett has been the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway since 1970.[8] He has been referred to as
    the "Oracle" or "Sage" of Omaha by global media outlets.[9][10] He is noted for his adherence to value investing and for
    his personal frugality despite his immense wealth.[11] Research published at the University of Oxford characterizes
    Buffett's investment methodology as falling within "founder centrism" – defined by a deference to managers with a
    founder's mindset, an ethical disposition towards the shareholder collective, and an intense focus on exponential value
    creation. Essentially, Buffett's concentrated investments shelter managers from the short-term pressures of the
    market.[12]

    Buffett is a notable philanthropist, having pledged to give away 99 percent[13] of his fortune to philanthropic causes,
    primarily via the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He founded The Giving Pledge in 2009 with Bill Gates, whereby
    billionaires pledge to give away at least half of their fortunes.[14]
