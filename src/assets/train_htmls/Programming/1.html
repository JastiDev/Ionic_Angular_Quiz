<h3 style="color:blue;">What is a program?</h3>

  Reading assignment: learn about the binary system
  A computer is a tool for solving problems with data.

A program is a sequence of instructions that tell a computer how to do a task. When a computer follows the instructions
in a program, we say it executes the program. You can think of it like a recipe that tells you how to make a peanut
butter sandwich. In this model, you are the computer, making a sandwich is the task, and the recipe is the program that
tells you how to execute the task.

Activity: Come up with a sequence of instructions to tell someone how to make a peanut butter sandwich. Don't leave any
steps out, or put them in the wrong order.
Was that easy? Did you remember all the steps? Maybe you forgot to tell me to use a knife to spread the peanut butter.
Now I've got peanut butter all over my hands! Of course, you say, a person wouldn't be that dumb. But a computer is that
dumb. A computer will only do what you tell it to do. This might make programming frustrating at first, but it's
relieving in a way: if you do everything right, you know exactly what the computer is going to do, because you told it.

Of course, computers don't understand recipes written on paper. Computers are machines, and at the most basic level,
they are a collection of switches—where 1 represents "on" and 0 represents "off". Everything that a computer does is
implemented in this most basic of all numbering systems—binary. If you really wanted to tell a computer what to do
directly, you'd have to talk to it in binary, giving it coded sequences of 1s and 0s that tell it which instructions to
execute. However, this is nearly impossible. In practice, we use a programming language.
